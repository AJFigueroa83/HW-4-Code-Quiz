# HW-4-Code-Quiz

## Description

In this project I present to you my first coded quiz game. A basic quiz game comprised of ten questions to test your knowledge. In this case, it is a basic sommelier's quiz. The questions are set up in a multiple choice format. Once you have chosen your answer you can click on the next button for the next question. If you chose a wrong answer you can keep tryin until you get the right one before proceedin, but be careful, every wrong answer will cost you time. Go on, give it a try! Cheers!! ðŸ¥‚

## Purpose

This quiz set out to test some basic knowledge from the world of alcoholic beverages. There is a lot more to this treat than just taking a sip. When fully devolped this could be a great tool to be used to help in the advancement of the sommelier profession by puting the students through a more rigorous, dynamic, testing experience.
